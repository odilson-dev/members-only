# README

A project for The Odin Project, visit it at: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-members-only

Few things I left out:
1. Styling - I left it out because it's not a requirement for the project to be completed. I will practice them styling with rails on bigger and possibly portfolio-worthy projects
1. Deploying - I was able to deploy the railsblog project, the project way before this one, and it had to do with changing config and changing the db from SQLite to PostgreSQL. I decided before starting this project to not deploy this one because PostgreSQL will be taught in the next lessons.
